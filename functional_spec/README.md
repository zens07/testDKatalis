# python3-template
Basic things i like to have in all of my python projects.
This Template installs Flask as a sample runtime requirement.

## Dependencies

This Template contains (currently) two different ways to handle requirements.
Before you start choose one option and remove the unnecessary files.
Then go into the makefile and activate / deactivate the way you want to handle 
the dependencies.
